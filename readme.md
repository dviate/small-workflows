### Alfred Commit Folders - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/commit%20folders.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
- Simple workflow that lets you search folders and then write a commit message. It would then `git add` and `git commit` all files in the folder with the message you provide. And finally it would `git push` the changes.
- This workflow assumes that the folder you select is already initialised with git as it is a file filter that searches through all the folders. It will however warn you if the folder you chose is not under git.
- You can of course modify the scope of the search or even make it that it only searches through git initialised folders but for my use case, I use this workflow when I make a change to some README file in some folder and want to quickly commit it without going to my terminal.
- For quickly editing README's of folders I use this [workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-folder-search) that searches through all folders and with a modifier key press will open the README in the markdown editor you set up. 
- There is also alternative action that will commit only the README file inside the folder with a predefined commit message. Again all the commit messages can be customised to what you prefer.

### Dash Profile Switcher - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/dash%20profile%20switch.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
- [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is a wonderful documentation tool for macOS. It allows you to create profiles to scope your global searches.
	- It also provides you to set custom URLs to switch between these profiles.
- So I made a workflow to switch between different profiles. Here is how it looks :
- You can customise the Dash profile keyword triggers in profile settings here:

- And then you can call these triggers using this URL scheme : `dash://go:`
	- Where you can change `go` to the trigger you set. This workflow simply lets you search through the profiles you have and will call this URL scheme for you. Adapt it to how you like it.

### Dash Search (with custom hotkeys) - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/Dash.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
- An extenstion of [official Dash workflow](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-Alfred-Workflow) that I extended with many custom hotkeys

### Contacts search - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/Contacts%20filter.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
- Made by [Vero](https://www.alfredforum.com/profile/1-vero/) but she has not uploaded it anywhere and I think it is super useful
- It is a file filter for contacts where you can not only search for names of contacts but also for notes attached to these contacts

### GitHub Jump - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/GitHub%20jump.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
- Not my workflow so all credit goes to [Lachlan Donald](https://github.com/lox) who made the [original workflow](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump)
- This is just my augmentation of it to make an amazing workflow even better
	- you can use modifiers to do different things such as go directly to issues of the workflow, pull requests of it or even clone the repo to a specified directory
