# Small Alfred Workflows I use üé© [![Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-üíó-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

## Description üìï
This is a collection of Alfred Workflows that do some small things and don't really warrant a GitHub repository of their own.

Each workflow lives in its own folder and a download link to each workflow is provided.

## Workflows üé©
### Objects library
- currently contains only [vitor's](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) [OneUpdater](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/OneUpdater)

### Find files
- a lot of [file filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/) for various apps I use

### Abbreviations
- I sometimes forget what ymmv abbreviation means so I made this list filter to quickly remind me
- I stopped using it in favour of searching [abbreivations](http://www.abbreviations.com) website instead
- but you can take this idea to make your own simple list filters

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/abbreviations.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Copy months numbers
- a simple workflow that will let you search for a month from the 12 months in a year and copy the month number to your clipboard
- because I always found it too hard to remember these numbers

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/show%20month%20numbers.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Check wifi connection / restart wifi / toggle it on/off
- it can :
	1. **check wifi** : it pings Google.com and if there is no response, you are offline and you get notification on the top
	2. **restart wifi** : turns the wifi on and off
	3. **toggle wifi on/off** : if on, will turn it off, if off will turn it on

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/wifi.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Reload Karabiner XML
- I use it all the time to quickly iterate on Karabiner. Only works on old [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner)

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/karabiner.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Clean Folders
- little list filter I use to filter my file system
- currently use it to clean all items from Desktop and removing all alfred workflows from ~/Downloads

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/clean%20folders.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Folder Search
- search folders from Alfred and open them in Finder / iTerm / Editor

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/folder%20search.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Static Searches
- In case there is no Alfred workflow dedicated to some website search that provides autosuggestions like [Searchio](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio), I use my [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) workflow, wwhich contains a large array of websites I can make searches on moderated by the community
- However certain searches I do so often that I create a separate objects for them in Alfred and attach a hotkey on them. Things like searching on GitHub or Reddit. I also have the power to modify the search with modifer keys so ‚åÉ + return on GitHub search will scope my query to bring me only the most recent stuff.

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/static%20searches.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Useful File Actions
- Here are a bunch of small file actions I use to operate on files
	1. opening folder/file in Visual Studio Code (change for editor you like)
	2. copying files to Desktop

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/useful%20file%20actions.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Search Selected Text on the Web
- Simple workflow I use to search highlighted text on various websites
- You can customise the hotkeys to ones you like. To make things easier for myself, I call the hotkeys from Karabiner with my custom modifier keys which you can take a look [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) for.
- I also heavily use [Web Searches workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) to search selected text on a wider array of websites

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/search%20web%20with%20selection.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Go to Reddit Subreddit from Alfred
- simple workflow that will let you go to a subreddit you specify
- If you want to search for available subreddits with autosuggestions, you can try [this workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-reddit)

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/go%20to%20subreddit.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Go Play - code -> playground
- This is a simple workflow that will take the code you select and let you create either [Official Go playground](https://play.golang.org/) or [Go play Space playground](https://goplay.space) that you can then share on IRC, Slack or with other gophers around you

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/go%20play.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Alfred Commit Folders
- Simple workflow that lets you search folders and then write a commit message. It would then `git add` and `git commit` all files in the folder with the message you provide. And finally it would `git push` the changes.
- This workflow assumes that the folder you select is already initialised with git as it is a file filter that searches through all the folders. It will however warn you if the folder you chose is not under git.
- You can of course modify the scope of the search or even make it that it only searches through git initialised folders but for my use case, I use this workflow when I make a change to some README file in some folder and want to quickly commit it without going to my terminal.
- For quickly editing README's of folders I use this [workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-folder-search) that searches through all folders and with a modifier key press will open the README in the markdown editor you set up. 
- There is also alternative action that will commit only the README file inside the folder with a predefined commit message. Again all the commit messages can be customised to what you prefer.

#### 

### Dash Profile Switcher
- [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is a wonderful documentation tool for macOS. It allows you to create profiles to scope your global searches.
	- It also provides you to set custom URLs to switch between these profiles.
- So I made a workflow to switch between different profiles. Here is how it looks :

- You can customise the Dash profile keyword triggers in profile settings here :

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yGvrOwE.png" width="400" alt="img">

- And then you can call these triggers using this URL scheme : `dash://go:`
	- Where you can change `go` to the trigger you set. This workflow simply lets you search through the profiles you have and will call this URL scheme for you. Adapt it to how you like it.
