# Small Alfred Workflows I use üé© [![Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-üíó-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

## Description üìï
This is a collection of Alfred Workflows that do some small things and don't really warrant a GitHub repository of their own.

Each workflow lives in its own folder and a download link to each workflow is provided.

## Workflows üé©
### objects library
- currently contains only [vitor's](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) [OneUpdater](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/OneUpdater) 
- I use this workflow to quickly copy useful premade objects to my workflows

### dictionary search
- search through dictionary from Alfred
	- I stopped using in favour of opening Dictionary itself and then making the search
	- I also only use Dictionary to read and explore wiki

#### [download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/dictionary.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### useful utilities 
- only has one utility so far and that is to open Alfred prompt with whatever I have selected passed in
	- I may add more in the future

### find files
- a lot of [file filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/) for various apps I use

#### [download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/find%20files.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### search for content
- two actions to search through the inside PDF and MindNode documents

#### [download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/search%20for%20content.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### abbreviations
- I sometimes forget what ymmv abbreviation means so I made this list filter to quickly remind me
- I stopped using it in favour of searching [abbreivations](http://www.abbreviations.com) website instead
- but you can take this idea to make your own simple list filters

#### [download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/abbreviations.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### months numbers
- a simple workflow that will let you search for a month from the 12 months in a year and copy the month number to your clipboard
- because I always found it too hard to remember these numbers

#### [download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/show%20month%20numbers.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### check wifi connection / restart wifi / toggle it on/off
- it can :
	1. **check wifi** : it pings Google.com and if there is no response, you are offline and you get notification on the top
	2. **restart wifi** : turns the wifi on and off
	3. **toggle wifi on/off** : if on, will turn it off, if off will turn it on
