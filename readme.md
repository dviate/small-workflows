# Small Alfred Workflows I use üé© [![Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-üíó-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

## Description üìï
This is a collection of Alfred Workflows that do some small things and don't really warrant a GitHub repository of their own.

Each workflow lives in its own folder and a download link to each workflow is provided.

## Workflows üé©
### Objects library
- currently contains only [vitor's](https://github.com/vitorgalvao) [OneUpdater](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/OneUpdater) 
- I use this workflow to quickly copy useful premade objects to my workflows

### Contact actions
- only has one [contact action](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/contact-action/) there, facetime
	- I then set phone number to trigger facetime call here

### Dictionary search
- search through dictionary from Alfred
	- I stopped using in favour of opening Dictionary itself and then making the search
	- I also only use Dictionary to read and explore wiki

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/dictionary.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Useful utilities 
- only has one utility so far and that is to open Alfred prompt with whatever I have selected passed in
	- I may add more in the future

### Find files
- a lot of [file filters](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/inputs/file-filter/) for various apps I use

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/find%20files.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Search for content
- two actions to search through the inside PDF and MindNode documents

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/search%20for%20content.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Abbreviations
- I sometimes forget what ymmv abbreviation means so I made this list filter to quickly remind me
- I stopped using it in favour of searching [abbreivations](http://www.abbreviations.com) website instead
- but you can take this idea to make your own simple list filters

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/abbreviations.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Copy months numbers
- a simple workflow that will let you search for a month from the 12 months in a year and copy the month number to your clipboard
- because I always found it too hard to remember these numbers

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/show%20month%20numbers.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Check wifi connection / restart wifi / toggle it on/off
- it can :
	1. **check wifi** : it pings Google.com and if there is no response, you are offline and you get notification on the top
	2. **restart wifi** : turns the wifi on and off
	3. **toggle wifi on/off** : if on, will turn it off, if off will turn it on

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/wifi.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Imgur album -> Desktop
- will take an active url from your browser that is an imgur album and download it to your desktop

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/imgur%20album%20downloader.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Reload Karabiner XML
- I use it all the time to quickly iterate on Karabiner. Only works on old [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner)

#### [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/workflows/karabiner.alfredworkflow?raw=true)

### Clean Folders
- little list filter I use to filter my file system
- currently use it to clean all items from Desktop and removing all alfred workflows from ~/Downloads
