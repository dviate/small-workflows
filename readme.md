<h1 align="center"> Description üìï</h1>

This is a collection of Alfred Workflows that do some small things and don't really warrant a GitHub repository of their own.

Each workflow lives in its own folder and a download link to each workflow is provided.

# dictionary search
- search through dictionary from Alfred

	- I also only use Dictionary to read and explore wiki

# useful utilities

# abbreviations
- I sometimes forget what ymmv abbreviation means so I made this list filter to quickly remind me
- I stopped using it in favour of searching [abbreivations](http://www.abbreviations.com) website instead
- but you can take this idea to make your own simple list filters
