## Workflow Augmentations 
> Workflows that were not made by me, I just augmented them in my own way to make them 'better' (for me). Credit goes to the authors of these awesome workflows.

### [GitHub Jump](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/GitHub%20jump.alfredworkflow?raw=true) (Credit to [Lachlan Donald](https://github.com/lox)) ([Original](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump))
> Quickly jump to a GitHub repository page.

- I added many modifiers to do different things such as go directly to issues of the workflow, pull requests of it or even clone the repo to a specified directory.
- I use this workflow many many times a day and it saved me a lot of time.

### [Dash Search with custom hotkeys](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Dash.alfredworkflow?raw=true) (Credit to [Bogdan Popescu](https://github.com/Kapeli)) ([Original](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-Alfred-Workflow))
> Search Dash docs.

- I extended it with many custom hotkeys to super quickly search a specific docset in [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash).

### [Alfred Workflow Directory](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Workflow%20directory.alfredworkflow?raw=true) (Credit to [Jeef](https://github.com/jeeftor)) ([Original](https://github.com/jeeftor/AlfredWorkflowDirectory))
- I changed it so that by default it will cd to the workflow in my current iTerm tab but also it can export workflow to `~/Desktop` (you can change location) or it will open the workflow with an editor (VS Code or Sublime in my case).

### [Directory watches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?raw=true) (Credit to [VÃ­tor GalvÃ£o](https://github.com/vitorgalvao))
- I modified a script he once shared to quickly see insides of various directories and action on items of them to do various things opening the path in iTerm or moving the file somewhere.
- Be careful though as it contains some actions that you must certainly not want but I kept them there in case you find it interesting and adapt it to your own needs.
