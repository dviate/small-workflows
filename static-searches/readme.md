# Static Searches - [Download](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/static-searches/Static%20searches.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
> Make searches on popular websites. I use [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) and [Searchio](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio) for all other searches.

I also add many modifier key options to scope my searches better.
